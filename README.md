# bio_calc
Just an algorithm/calculator I'm making to help with biology IAs for some friends

HOW TO USE:
To calculate the percent change and uncertainty change over every weeks sample data, customize the
- data: table containing all the data for every week, organized by solution volume, with each array containing 5 datas for each of the 5 samples
- uncertainty (unc): value of uncertainty for the entire experiment
- decimal value: what value you want to round to
